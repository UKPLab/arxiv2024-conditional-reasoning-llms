Rule4: If the rabbit gives a magnifying glass to the canary and the hummingbird gives a magnifying glass to the canary, then the canary knows the defense plan of the mosquito. Rule1 is preferred over Rule4. Rule2 is preferred over Rule4. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the aardvark hold the same number of points as the hippopotamus?",
        "proof": "We know the rabbit gives a magnifier to the canary and the hummingbird gives a magnifier to the canary, and according to Rule4 \"if the rabbit gives a magnifier to the canary and the hummingbird gives a magnifier to the canary, then the canary knows the defensive plans of the mosquito\", and for the conflicting and higher priority rule Rule2 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the canary has more than 3 friends\" and for Rule1 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the canary has something to drink\", so we can conclude \"the canary knows the defensive plans of the mosquito\". We know the canary knows the defensive plans of the mosquito, and according to Rule3 \"if at least one animal knows the defensive plans of the mosquito, then the aardvark holds the same number of points as the hippopotamus\", so we can conclude \"the aardvark holds the same number of points as the hippopotamus\". So the statement \"the aardvark holds the same number of points as the hippopotamus\" is proved and the answer is \"yes\".",
