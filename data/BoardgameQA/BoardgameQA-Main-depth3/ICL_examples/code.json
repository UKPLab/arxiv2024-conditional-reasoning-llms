    "proof": "We know the polar bear does not sing a victory song for the mosquito, and according to Rule2 \"if the polar bear does not sing a victory song for the mosquito, then the mosquito needs support from the donkey\", so we can conclude \"the mosquito needs support from the donkey\".

We know the caterpillar has a card that is green in color, green is a primary color, and according to Rule1 \"if the caterpillar has a card with a primary color, then the caterpillar offers a job to the cricket\", so we can conclude \"the caterpillar offers a job to the cricket\". We know the squid does not attack the green fields whose owner is the caterpillar, and according to Rule4 \"if the squid does not attack the green fields whose owner is the caterpillar, then the caterpillar does not burn the warehouse of the puffin\", so we can conclude \"the caterpillar does not burn the warehouse of the puffin\". We know the caterpillar does not burn the warehouse of the puffin and the caterpillar offers a job to the cricket, and according to Rule7 \"if something does not burn the warehouse of the puffin and offers a job to the cricket, then it raises a peace flag for the canary\", and for the conflicting and higher priority rule Rule5 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the starfish owes money to the caterpillar\", so we can conclude \"the caterpillar raises a peace flag for the canary\". We know the caterpillar raises a peace flag for the canary and the donkey steals five points from the canary, and according to Rule6 \"if the caterpillar raises a peace flag for the canary and the donkey steals five points from the canary, then the canary eats the food of the buffalo\", so we can conclude \"the canary eats the food of the buffalo\".
