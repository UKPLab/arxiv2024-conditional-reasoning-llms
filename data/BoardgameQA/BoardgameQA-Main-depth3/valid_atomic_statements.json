We know the grasshopper does not attack the green fields whose owner is the baboon, and according to Rule10 \"if the grasshopper does not attack the green fields whose owner is the baboon, then the baboon burns the warehouse of the cat\", so we can conclude \"the baboon burns the warehouse of the cat\".

We know the panther purchased a luxury aircraft, and according to Rule14 \"if the panther owns a luxury aircraft, then the panther becomes an enemy of the cat\", and Rule14 has a higher preference than the conflicting rules (Rule3), so we can conclude \"the panther becomes an enemy of the cat\". We know the panther becomes an enemy of the cat, and according to Rule2 \"if the panther becomes an enemy of the cat, then the cat does not knock down the fortress of the octopus\", so we can conclude \"the cat does not knock down the fortress of the octopus\". We know the cat does not knock down the fortress of the octopus and the cat offers a job to the phoenix, and according to Rule11 \"if something does not knock down the fortress of the octopus and offers a job to the phoenix, then it does not knock down the fortress of the grizzly bear\", so we can conclude \"the cat does not knock down the fortress of the grizzly bear\".

Rule3: The turtle offers a job to the bat whenever at least one animal removes from the board one of the pieces of the cheetah. Rule4: If at least one animal winks at the eagle, then the lobster needs the support of the turtle. Rule5: If you are positive that one of the animals does not attack the green fields whose owner is the panda bear, you can be certain that it will not need support from the turtle. Rule6: If the meerkat has access to an abundance of food, then the meerkat does not wink at the eagle. Rule7: If the meerkat has a card whose color is one of the rainbow colors, then the meerkat does not wink at the eagle. Rule8: Regarding the swordfish, if it has something to carry apples and oranges, then we can conclude that it does not know the defense plan of the turtle. Rule9: If the meerkat has something to carry apples and oranges, then the meerkat winks at the eagle. Rule10: If something prepares armor for the baboon, then it burns the warehouse that is in possession of the donkey, too. Rule11: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals attacks the green fields of the spider, you can be certain that it will not offer a job to the bat. Rule12: Regarding the meerkat, if it has more than 10 friends, then we can conclude that it winks at the eagle. Rule13: If at least one animal prepares armor for the octopus, then the sheep does not burn the warehouse that is in possession of the donkey. Rule14: The eel does not eat the food that belongs to the squirrel, in the case where the rabbit sings a victory song for the eel. Rule15: If the swordfish has something to sit on, then the swordfish does not know the defensive plans of the turtle. Rule16: If the salmon has a card whose color appears in the flag of Japan, then the salmon removes one of the pieces of the cheetah. Rule17: Be careful when something does not knock down the fortress of the amberjack but offers a job position to the bat because in this case it will, surely, need the support of the grasshopper (this may or may not be problematic). Rule18: The lobster does not attack the green fields whose owner is the panda bear whenever at least one animal removes one of the pieces of the viperfish. Rule10 is preferred over Rule13. Rule11 is preferred over Rule3. Rule5 is preferred over Rule4. Rule6 is preferred over Rule12. Rule6 is preferred over Rule9. Rule7 is preferred over Rule12. Rule7 is preferred over Rule9. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the turtle need support from the grasshopper?",
        "proof": "We know the rabbit sings a victory song for the eel, and according to Rule14 \"if the rabbit sings a victory song for the eel, then the eel does not eat the food of the squirrel\", so we can conclude \"the eel does not eat the food of the squirrel\". We know the black bear removes from the board one of the pieces of the viperfish, and according to Rule18 \"if at least one animal removes from the board one of the pieces of the viperfish, then the lobster does not attack the green fields whose owner is the panda bear\", so we can conclude \"the lobster does not attack the green fields whose owner is the panda bear\". We know the salmon has a card that is red in color, red appears in the flag of Japan, and according to Rule16 \"if the salmon has a card whose color appears in the flag of Japan, then the salmon removes from the board one of the pieces of the cheetah\", so we can conclude \"the salmon removes from the board one of the pieces of the cheetah\". We know the salmon removes from the board one of the pieces of the cheetah, and according to Rule3 \"if at least one animal removes from the board one of the pieces of the cheetah, then the turtle offers a job to the bat\", and for the conflicting and higher priority rule Rule11 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the turtle attacks the green fields whose owner is the spider\", so we can conclude \"the turtle offers a job to the bat\". We know the sheep prepares armor for the baboon, and according to Rule10 \"if something prepares armor for the baboon, then it burns the warehouse of the donkey\", and Rule10 has a higher preference than the conflicting rules (Rule13), so we can conclude \"the sheep burns the warehouse of the donkey\". We know the sheep burns the warehouse of the donkey, and according to Rule1 \"if at least one animal burns the warehouse of the donkey, then the turtle does not knock down the fortress of the amberjack\", so we can conclude \"the turtle does not knock down the fortress of the amberjack\". We know the turtle does not knock down the fortress of the amberjack and the turtle offers a job to the bat, and according to Rule17 \"if something does not knock down the fortress of the amberjack and offers a job to the bat, then it needs support from the grasshopper\", so we can conclude \"the turtle needs support from the grasshopper\".

        "proof": "We know the kangaroo has three friends, 3 is fewer than 9, and according to Rule7 \"if the kangaroo has fewer than nine friends, then the kangaroo does not become an enemy of the hare\", and for the conflicting and higher priority rule Rule6 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the kangaroo removes from the board one of the pieces of the black bear\", so we can conclude \"the kangaroo does not become an enemy of the hare\". We know the tilapia burns the warehouse of the baboon, and according to Rule4 \"if at least one animal burns the warehouse of the baboon, then the kangaroo attacks the green fields whose owner is the dog\", so we can conclude \"the kangaroo attacks the green fields whose owner is the dog\". We know the kangaroo attacks the green fields whose owner is the dog and the kangaroo does not become an enemy of the hare, and according to Rule3 \"if something attacks the green fields whose owner is the dog but does not become an enemy of the hare, then it becomes an enemy of the turtle\", so we can conclude \"the kangaroo becomes an enemy of the turtle\". We know the kangaroo becomes an enemy of the turtle, and according to Rule1 \"if the kangaroo becomes an enemy of the turtle, then the turtle does not owe money to the eagle\", so we can conclude \"the turtle does not owe money to the eagle\".
