The EPA was registered in 2006. As his illness has progressed, it's no longer practical for him to receive care in the home and two of us believe that it is in his best interests for him to move into a residential care home. This has financial implications for him as he would have to partly self-fund the care from the sale of his current home. The other sibling disagrees and wants him to remain at home..

Can I still use annual investment allowance in this case?\nDocument: <h1>Writing down allowances</h1>\n<p>When you buy business assets you can usually deduct the full value from your profits before tax using annual investment allowance (AIA).</p>\n<p>Use writing down allowances instead if:</p>\n<li>you\u2019ve already claimed AIA on items worth a total of more than the AIA amount</li>\n<li>the item doesn\u2019t qualify for AIA (for example, cars, gifts or things you owned before you used them in your business)</li>\n<p>Writing down allowances is when you deduct a percentage of the value of an item from your profits each year.</p>\n<p>The percentage you deduct depends on the item. For business cars the rate depends on their CO2 emissions.</p>\n<h2>Work out the value of your item</h2>\n<p>In most cases, the value is what you paid for the item. Use the market value (the amount you\u2019d expect to sell it for) instead if:</p>\n<li>you owned it before you started using it in your business</li>\n<li>it was a gift</li>\n<h2>Items you use outside your business</h2>\n<p>For items that are in a single asset pool because you\u2019ve used them outside your business, reduce the amount you can claim by the amount you use them privately.</p>\n<p>You still deduct the full amount from your pool to get the closing balance.</p>\nAnswers can be \"yes\" or \"no\".

I am not currently VAT registered, but my turnover is approaching the threshold for registration. This figure, however, includes mail order sales to customers outside the UK, which I believe are currently zero-rated in VAT terms.. Do sales of zero-rated items count towards the threshold when calculating my turnover for a given twelve month period?\nDocument: <h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>You must register your business for VAT with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) if its VAT taxable turnover is more than \u00a385,000.</p>\n<p>When you register, you\u2019ll be sent a VAT registration certificate. This confirms:</p>\n<li>your VAT number</li>\n<li>when to submit your first VAT Return and payment</li>\n<li>your \u2018effective date of registration\u2019 - this depends on the date you went over the threshold, or is the date you asked to register if it was voluntary</li>\n<p>You can register voluntarily if your turnover is less than \u00a385,000, unless everything you sell is exempt.

This is not a fixed period like the tax year or the calendar year - it could be any period, for example the start of June to the end of May.</p>\n<p>The current threshold is \u00a385,000.
