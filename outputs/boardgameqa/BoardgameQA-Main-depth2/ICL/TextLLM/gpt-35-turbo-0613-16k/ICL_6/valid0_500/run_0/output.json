We know the raven is named Lucy and the starfish is named Lily, and their names do not have the same first letter, so we cannot conclude that \"the raven does not respect the crocodile\" based on Rule3. We know the hummingbird has a card that is red in color, and according to Rule4 \"if the hummingbird has a card whose color appears in the flag of Italy, then we can conclude that it needs the support of the crocodile\", and red appears in the flag of Italy, so we can conclude that \"the hummingbird needs the support of the crocodile\". We know the belief is that the raven is not going to respect the crocodile and the hummingbird needs the support of the crocodile, and according to Rule1 \"if the belief is that the raven is not going to respect the crocodile but the hummingbird needs the support of the crocodile, then we can add that 'the crocodile is not going to proceed to the spot that is right after the spot of the amberjack' to our conclusions\", so we can conclude that \"the crocodile does not proceed to the spot right after the amberjack\". So the statement \"the crocodile proceeds to the spot right after the amberjack\" is disproved and the answer is \"no\".", "answer": -1}, {"idx": 494, "response": "We know the grasshopper has a cell phone, which is a device to connect to the internet, and according to Rule3 \"if the grasshopper has a device to connect to the internet, then the grasshopper does not raise a peace flag for the polar bear\", so we can conclude \"the grasshopper does not raise a peace flag for the polar bear\". We know the grasshopper does not raise a peace flag for the polar bear, and according to Rule2 \"if the grasshopper raises a peace flag for the polar bear, then the polar bear needs support from the sea bass\", so we can conclude \"the polar bear does not need support from the sea bass\". So the statement \"the polar bear needs support from the sea bass\" is disproved and the answer is \"no\".", "answer": -1}, {"idx": 495, "response": "We know the aardvark removes from the board one of the pieces of the cat, and according to Rule2 \"if at least one animal removes from the board one of the pieces of the cat, then the lobster needs support from the turtle\", so we can conclude \"the lobster needs support from the turtle\". We know the lobster needs support from the turtle, and according to Rule5 \"if something offers a job position to the bat but does not knock down the fortress of the amberjack, then it also needs support from the grasshopper\", so we can conclude \"the turtle needs support from the grasshopper\". So the statement \"the turtle needs support from the grasshopper\" is proved and the answer is \"yes\".", "answer": 1}, {"idx": 496, "response": "We know the wolverine is named Lola and the sun bear is named Lily, both names start with \"L\", and according to Rule3 \"if the wolverine has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the sun bear's name, then it removes one of the pieces of the blobfish\", so we can conclude \"the wolverine removes one of the pieces of the blobfish\". We know the wolverine removes one of the pieces of the blobfish, and according to Rule1 \"if something removes one of the pieces of the blobfish, then it does not know the defensive plans of the panther\", so we can conclude \"the wolverine does not know the defensive plans of the panther\".

We know the sheep will never burn the warehouse that is in possession of the phoenix, and according to Rule4 \"if you see that something becomes an enemy of the squirrel but does not burn the warehouse of the phoenix, you can conclude that it eats the food of the cricket\", so we can conclude \"the sheep eats the food of the cricket\". So the statement \"the sheep eats the food of the cricket\" is proved and the answer is \"yes\".", "answer": 1}, {"idx": 498, "response": "We know the eel does not knock down the fortress of the moose, and according to Rule3 \"the moose unquestionably prepares armor for the swordfish, in the case where the eel does not knock down the fortress that belongs to the moose\". Since the eel does not knock down the fortress of the moose, we can conclude \"the moose prepares armor for the swordfish\".\n\nAccording to Rule5, if something prepares armor for the swordfish and does not burn the warehouse that is in possession of the crocodile, we can conclude that it also prepares armor for the wolverine. Since we have established that the moose prepares armor for the swordfish, and there is no information about the moose burning the warehouse of the crocodile, we can conclude that \"the moose prepares armor for the wolverine\".\n\nTherefore, based on the game state and the rules, the moose does prepare armor for the wolverine.", "answer": 0}, {"idx": 499, "response": "We know the kangaroo has fourteen friends, and according to Rule3 \"if the kangaroo has fewer than 5 friends, then the kangaroo does not become an actual enemy of the turtle\", so we can conclude \"the kangaroo does not become an actual enemy of the turtle\".
