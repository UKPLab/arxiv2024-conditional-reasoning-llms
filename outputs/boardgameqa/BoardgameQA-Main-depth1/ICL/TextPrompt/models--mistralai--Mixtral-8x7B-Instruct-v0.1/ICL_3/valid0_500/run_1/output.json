But in this case, the moose's name does not match the first letter of the black bear's name, so this rule does not apply. Next, we consider Rule3, which states that if the moose has fewer than 13 friends, then the moose does not prepare armor for the wolverine. The information about the moose's friends is not provided, so we can't apply this rule. Finally, we consider Rule1, which states that if the moose does not burn the warehouse that is in possession of the crocodile but it prepares armor for the swordfish, then it also prepares armor for the wolverine.
